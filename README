# 🚀 Local-Doc-Insight-RAG (MCP Server)

An advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) server that allows you to chat with your local PDF and text documents privately. This project is built using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for seamless integration with AI tools.



## ✨ Key Features
* **Privacy-First:** All document processing and embedding generation happen locally on your machine.
* **Semantic Search:** Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to understand the actual meaning of your text, not just keywords.
* **Fast Indexing:** Powered by **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for near-instant retrieval.
* **Hardware Optimized:** Specifically tuned to run on CPU-only laptops (like Lenovo Yoga) without requiring a high-end GPU.

## 🛠 Technical Challenges Overcome
During development, several critical environment issues were resolved to ensure stability:
* **Stable Runtime:** Migrated from experimental Python 3.14 to **Python 3.12.8** to fix `metadata-generation-failed` errors during package installation.
* **DLL Fix:** Resolved `WinError 1114` (DLL initialization failed) by correctly configuring the environment for CPU-based execution.
* **Dependency Management:** Fixed installation issues for `sentence-transformers` and `torch` on Windows 11.

## 📦 Requirements
* **Python:** 3.12.x (Recommended)
* **Libraries:** `mcp`, `sentence-transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, `pypdf`, `numpy`

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Local-Doc-Insight-RAG.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Local-Doc-Insight-RAG.git)
